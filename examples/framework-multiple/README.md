# Multiple frameworks example

This example shows Phoria Islands using multiple UI frameworks (React, Svelte and Vue) in the same project.

> This example is a work in progress. It also uses a pnpm workspace, which will likely be moved into a separate example project in future so that this example can be simplified.
