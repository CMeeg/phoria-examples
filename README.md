# phoria-examples

Example projects that can be used to test out Phoria or guide setting up your own project.

Each of the folders under [`examples`](./examples/) is a self-contained project that can be run independently of the others.

More examples will be added over time, but please raise an issue if you have an idea for an example or would like to contribute.
