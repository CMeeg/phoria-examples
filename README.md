# Phoria examples

Example projects that can be used to get started with [Phoria](https://github.com/CMeeg/phoria).

Each of the folders under [`examples`](./examples/) is a self-contained project that can be run independently of the others. See the [getting started guide](https://github.com/CMeeg/phoria/#getting-started) for more information on how to use the examples as a template to create your own project.

> [!NOTE]
> More examples will be added over time, but please raise an issue if you have an idea for an example or would like to contribute.
